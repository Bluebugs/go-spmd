# SPMD Implementation Plan for Go + TinyGo

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: Implementation Planning Phase  

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, trackable implementation plan for adding Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) support to Go via TinyGo. The implementation follows a two-stage approach: Go frontend generates SPMD-aware SSA, TinyGo backend converts to WebAssembly SIMD128 instructions.

**Key Success Criterion**: ALL examples must compile to both SIMD and scalar WASM with identical behavior.

## Implementation Architecture

- **Go Frontend (Phase 1)**: SPMD syntax, type system, and SSA generation using standard opcodes
- **TinyGo Backend (Phase 2)**: SSA-to-LLVM IR conversion with dual SIMD/scalar code generation
- **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development using 20+ existing examples as primary test cases
- **Reference Patterns**: Follows ISPC/LLVM established SPMD implementation patterns

4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Meaningful only with actual SIMD vs scalar code generation

**⚠️ DEPENDENCY CHAIN**: Phase 0 ✅ → Phase 1.1-1.7 → **Phase 1.8-1.9 (CRITICAL)** → Phase 2 → Phase 3 PoC Validation

This plan serves as the definitive roadmap for SPMD implementation and should be updated as progress is made and new requirements are discovered.
