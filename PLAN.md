# SPMD Implementation Plan for Go + TinyGo

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: Implementation Planning Phase  

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, trackable implementation plan for adding Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) support to Go via TinyGo. The implementation follows a two-stage approach: Go frontend generates SPMD-aware SSA, TinyGo backend converts to WebAssembly SIMD128 instructions.

**Key Success Criterion**: ALL examples must compile to both SIMD and scalar WASM with identical behavior.

## Implementation Architecture

- **Go Frontend (Phase 1)**: SPMD syntax, type system, and SSA generation using standard opcodes
- **TinyGo Backend (Phase 2)**: SSA-to-LLVM IR conversion with dual SIMD/scalar code generation
- **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development using 20+ existing examples as primary test cases
- **Reference Patterns**: Follows ISPC/LLVM established SPMD implementation patterns

- All Phase 0 infrastructure tests continue to pass
- Phase 1.1 frontend GOEXPERIMENT integration is complete

**Key Technical Achievement**: GOEXPERIMENT infrastructure is fully operational for frontend development. Build constraints work correctly, graceful degradation functions properly, and the foundation is ready for Phase 1.2 lexer implementation.

### Recent Progress (Phase 1.2 - COMPLETED 2025-08-06)

✅ **Lexer Modifications Complete**

- Added _Uniform and_Varying tokens to src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/tokens.go with proper enum positioning
- Implemented context-sensitive keyword recognition in src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/scanner.go with buildcfg.Experiment.SPMD gating
- Updated token_string.go with correct token mapping arrays and string indices for new SPMD tokens
- Added setGOEXPERIMENT() helper function to parser_test.go for experiment control during testing
- Modified testFileWithSPMD() to properly set experiment flags during parsing with defer cleanup
- Updated SPMD test files with proper build constraints (//go:build goexperiment.spmd)
- All parser tests pass with correct GOEXPERIMENT flag behavior and backward compatibility maintained
- Successfully built modified Go toolchain with SPMD support enabled
- Verified context-sensitive lexing: uniform/varying are keywords only when GOEXPERIMENT=spmd is set
- Confirmed zero breaking changes to existing Go code when experiment is disabled

**Key Technical Achievement**: Context-sensitive lexer implementation is fully operational with GOEXPERIMENT integration. Uniform and varying keywords are recognized conditionally, backward compatibility is maintained, and the lexer foundation is ready for Phase 1.3 parser extensions.

**Important Architectural Finding**: During Phase 1.2 implementation, we discovered that true backward compatibility requires **parser-level context disambiguation**, not lexer-level. The current lexer correctly emits `_Uniform`/`_Varying` tokens when SPMD enabled, but the parser must distinguish between:

- `uniform int x` (SPMD type syntax - uniform as keyword)  
- `var uniform int = 42` (identifier usage - uniform as name)

This follows Go's established patterns for context-sensitive keywords and will be implemented in Phase 1.3 using grammar-based disambiguation with lookahead.

---

**Total Estimated Tasks**: 200+ checkboxes  
**Estimated Timeline**: 6-12 months for complete PoC implementation  

## PoC Success Criteria

**🔴 CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: PoC validation can only begin after Phase 1.8-1.9 (Standard Library) completion.

**Success Criteria**: ALL examples compile to both SIMD and scalar WASM with identical behavior

### Validation Dependencies

1. **Phase 1.8-1.9 REQUIRED**: `lanes` and `reduce` packages must be fully implemented
2. **Integration Tests**: Can only validate dual-mode compilation after standard library availability
3. **Example Execution**: All 22+ examples depend on standard library functions
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Meaningful only with actual SIMD vs scalar code generation

**⚠️ DEPENDENCY CHAIN**: Phase 0 ✅ → Phase 1.1-1.7 → **Phase 1.8-1.9 (CRITICAL)** → Phase 2 → Phase 3 PoC Validation

This plan serves as the definitive roadmap for SPMD implementation and should be updated as progress is made and new requirements are discovered.
